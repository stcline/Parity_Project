# FTC Historical Parity Project
In economics parity refers to the relative equality of interests.  This phenomenon has been used to compare currencies, incomes, purchasing power and other factors such as educational attainment on a global and state level. Professional sports leagues have famously sought to increase parity as a way of giving their clients (fans) more hope that their favorite team has a chance to win a title by various means such as revenue sharing, drafts and subsidizing expansion teams.  Parity in global economics and professional sports is viewed as an ethical pursuit and a vital profit motive. 

It has been observed anecdotally that in the FIRST Tech Challenge robotics competition, that parity has drastically decreased in the last decade.  The observation is that teams which are more well resourced have a disproportionate chance for competitive success, and by extension, more ability to influence those goals of FIRST.  If this assertion is true, it would undermine the objectives of the organization to grow STEM.  Higher degrees of parity would bring more students into FIRST just like it brings more fans to professional sports.  The primary difference here is that the "hope" garnered in the former does more than generate profits, it actually increases STEM educational achievement across broad populations.  This would then theoretically increase educational opportunities for a broader spectrum of students.  Since FIRST strives to be a global organization, this may have an impact far beyond the United States.

This research will examine this question of parity by using several competitive attributes (winning percentage and power ratins) as well as measures of longevity of programs.  Additionally, content analysis will attempt to determine what proportions of teams are associated with school (public, private, charter, etc.) and which are associated with other organizations or simply private teams.

This is meant to be a preliminary examination of these characteristics.  It will attempt to make these observations more
